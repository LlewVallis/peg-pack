# Security

First of all, you should never feed untrusted input into the Peg Pack command line tool.
This ought to be immediately obvious considering grammars are specified using arbitrary Javascript.

There are circumstances, however, where it is desirable to feed arbitrary input into a generated parser.
Parsers generated with Peg Pack should be safe for this purpose, provided you enforce sane limits on the size of the input you feed to the parser.
That said, Peg Pack has not undergone extensive testing for vulnerabilities, and as such you should factor in an appropriate amount of pessimism about its safety &mdash; just as you would with handwritten native code.
If you do find a case where a Peg Pack generated grammar crashes (or worse) with anything other than an unavoidable out of memory error, please [file an issue](https://github.com/LlewVallis/peg-pack/issues/new).
