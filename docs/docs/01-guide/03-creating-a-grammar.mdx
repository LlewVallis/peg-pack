# Creating a grammar

To start, we'll first create a new file to contain our grammar.
As previously mentioned, Peg Pack grammars are specified in vanilla Javascript, so we'll call it `grammar.js`.
Peg Pack will run this file using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and it's `module.exports` will designate the entrypoint of the grammar.

Here is a minimal grammar you can try out to test if your installation is working correctly:

```js
module.exports = "Hello, World!";
```

If you run the grammar from the command line using `peg-pack -i grammar.js` you can see that the parser will accept any string beginning with `Hello, World!` and reject all other input.

Peg Pack grammars have access to a special global variable, `g`, which contains the API you will use to write grammars.
After running `peg-pack` you can find Typescript declarations in the `peg-pack-out` directory, as well as your generated parser.

String literal rules in Peg Pack atomically match their exact text or fail to match without consuming any input.
Rules either match or don't match, but a successful match can embed a recoverable error.
Graceful error handling will be covered later, but for now we will consider parsers which atomically accept or reject their input.

## Sequences

One of the most primitive combinators is the sequence, which takes any number of rules and creates a new rule that matches each sub-rule one after the other.
This is spelled `g.seq(...)`.
Note that if any sub-rule fails to match the entire sequence also fails to match without consuming input.

We can update our example to make use of this new knowledge:

```js
module.exports = g.seq("Hello", ", ", "World", "!");
```

This is equivalent to our previous example, and in fact the optimizer will reduce the new grammar to the prior one.

## Choices

Another very common operation is choosing between two alternatives, which we do with a choice combinator.
When we specify a choice, we typically use `g.choice(...)` but there is also a separate `g.strictChoice(...)` function with subtly different semantics.
The distinction is important in the presence of error recovery and will be revisited later, but for now we will simply use `g.choice(...)`.

Semantically, choices attempt to match each sub-rule, embodying the first match or failing if no sub-rule matches.
The fact that choices attempt each sub-rule in order is important, and means that in general `g.choice(first, second)` is not the same as `g.choice(second, first)`.
This differs from many other parser generators that are based on generative formalisms where choice is fundamentally commutative operation.
To illustrate the difference, consider the regular expression `(a|ab)c` and the Peg Pack rule `g.seq(g.choice("a", "ab"), "c")`.
The regular expression accepts the string `abc` whereas the Peg Pack rule does not.
This is because in the Peg Pack rule, `"a"` matches, the choice is exited, and then `"c"` fails, causing the entire rule to fail.
For this reason Peg Pack is less declarative and more imperative than many parser generators.
The upside of this is that Peg Pack rules are unambiguous and simpler to reason about as sequence of steps.
A good rule of thumb is that the most specific, longest, or most constrained option should come first.

If we want to recognise either `Hello, World!` or `Hello, Peg Pack!` we could use the following grammar:

```js
module.exports = g.seq("Hello, ", g.choice("World", "Peg Pack"), "!");
```

## Splitting up rules

So far we've only looked at simple examples, but larger grammars won't want (and likely can't) specify an entire grammar on a single line.
Let's say we want to extract `g.choice("World", "Peg Pack")` in the previous example.
You might be tempted to write something like this:

```js
const subject = g.choice("World", "Peg Pack");
module.exports = g.seq("Hello, ", subject, "!");
```

This would work, but it is better practice to define all your rules as functions like below:

```js
const subject = () => g.choice("World", "Peg Pack");
module.exports = g.seq("Hello, ", subject, "!");
```

Defining rules as functions lets you create recursive and mutually recursive rules and will yield better error messages if you construct an invalid grammar.
Note that when we use `subject` on the second line we reference it without calling it.
This is important to maintain the aforementioned benefits and allows the runtime to invoke your function just once.

## Ranges

Let's say you want to match any ASCII digit.
With the tools presented so far you would need to use something like `g.choice("0", "1", ...)`.
This is clearly quite annoying, so Peg Pack provides the `g.oneOf(...)` and `g.noneOf(...)` combinators.
If these combinators match, they always match exactly one byte of input.
So, instead of our verbose choice, we can instead use `g.oneOf(["0", "9"])`.
We can also specify integers rather than strings.
For example, `g.oneOf([48, 57])` is equivalent to the previous example since 48 is the ASCII code of `0` and 57 is the code of `9`.
Multiple ranges can also be used.
For example, if we want lower and uppercase letters, we would use `g.oneOf(["a", "z"], ["A", "Z"])`.

The `g.noneOf(...)` combinator is similar, except that it accepts any byte not specified in any of the ranges.
For example, we can consume a non-null character using `g.noneOf([0, 0])`.
Since the upper and lower bounds of the range are both 0, we can just write `g.noneOf(0)`.

## Repetition

Let's say we want to parse a string consisting of zero or more `a`'s followed by a `b`.
One way to do this would be as follows:

```js
const as = () => g.choice(g.seq("a", as), "");
module.exports = g.seq(as, "b");
```

Logically the `as` rule matches an `a` and then:

* If successful, recursively tries to match more `a`'s.
* If unsuccessful, settles for matching the empty string instead.

You might think this would cause a stack overflow for large input, but Peg Pack does not use the stack to represent recursive rules.

This is a common pattern, so Peg Pack comes with `g.rep(_)` and `g.repOne(_)` to handle repetitions of zero or more and one or more respectively.
These are subtly different from the above implementation in that they use `g.strictChoice(...)` rather than `g.choice(...)` but are otherwise equivalent.
You can also specify an optional second argument to each which acts as a separator between each repetition.

With this in mind, we can rewrite the example above:

```js
module.exports = g.seq(g.rep("a"), "b");
```

## Left recursion

Now let's consider what would happen if we executed the following grammar:

```js
const inception = () => inception;
module.exports = inception;
```

If you try to run this, you'll see the Peg Pack command line tool complain.
This is an example of *left recursion*, which occurs whenever a rule invokes itself recursively without first consuming input.
Semantically, this represents an infinite loop since `inception` will continue to invoke itself forever.
Peg Pack uses static analysis to ensure that this never manifests in a generated parser.

Sometimes it isn't obvious why a rule is left recursive.
For example, consider `g.rep("")`.
Although we haven't written the recursion ourselves, this is indeed implicitly left recursive because of the way `g.rep(_)` is defined and more broadly because it contains an infinite loop.

Despite the apparent absurdity of left recursion, there are some grammars which can be elegantly specified left recursively.
Peg Pack aims to support such grammars natively in the future, but for now you'll need to rewrite your grammar to be right recursive.

## Lookahead

For complex grammars, you'll sometimes need a rule to match or fail based on future input without actually consuming in the case of a match.
In this case, you can use the `g.ahead(...)` and `g.notAhead(...)` combinators.

For example, `g.ahead("foo")` matches (without consuming any input) if and only if `"foo"` would match at the current position in the input.
Predictably, `g.notAhead("foo")` does the opposite, matching if `"foo"` would fail to match.

All the prior examples in this chapter accepted any amount of extraneous input after a successful parse.
We can use lookahead to prevent this.
Consider the rule `g.notAhead(g.noneOf())`.
Since `g.noneOf()` matches any character, `g.notAhead(g.noneOf())` matches the end of the input stream.
It stands to reason then that the following grammar will match `Hello, World!` but fail to match on any extraneous input:

```js
module.exports = g.seq("Hello, World!", g.notAhead(g.noneOf()));
```

This is a common pattern, so Peg Pack also provides `g.eof` to more cleanly express the end of input.

## More combinators

There are several other combinators provided for your convenience that are easily defined in terms of the other ones.
For a full list see the Typescript declaration file bundled with your generated parser.

| Combinator       | Description                                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `g.opt(...)`     | Optionally matches one of the arguments. Equivalent to `g.strictChoice(g.choice(...), "")`. |
| `g.empty`        | Always matches without consuming any input. Equivalent to `""` or `g.seq()`.                |
| `g.never`        | Always fails to match. Equivalent to `g.oneOf()` or `g.choice()`.                           |
| `g.any`          | Matches any single byte. Equivalent to `g.noneOf()`.                                        |
| `g.eof`          | Matches the end of the input stream. Equivalent to `g.notAhead(g.any)`                      |
| `g.anonymize(_)` | Has no semantics other than hiding the name of the passed function from the compiler.       |
