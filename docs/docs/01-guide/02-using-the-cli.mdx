# Using the CLI

Peg Pack is a command line tool that transforms a grammar into a working parser.
As such, we'll first need to install it!
Use the command below to download and install `peg-pack`:

```
cargo install peg-pack
```

If you don't have cargo, you'll need to install Rust [here](https://rustup.rs/).

Now that we've got that out of the way you should be able to run Peg Pack from the command line, for example:

```
peg-pack --help
```

The most important option to the CLI is of course going to be a path to your grammar, which is provided as a positional (not a flag) argument.
When debugging grammars, you can additionally specify the `-i` option and type some input to quickly see how an excerpt will parse.
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>D</kbd> on Unix, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> on Windows, when you've finished.

Here is an example of interactively running a parser:

```
peg-pack -i grammar.js
```

Beyond this, you can use the `-o` flag to configure where the generated parser and relevant build files will be placed.
For more, run `peg-pack --help`.
