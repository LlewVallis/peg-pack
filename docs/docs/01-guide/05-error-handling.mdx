# Error handling

So far we've constructed parsers that either match or fail, but for real world projects we don't want such a simple binary.
If our input is malformed, it would be useful to know where and in what way, and to still be able to analyze the parts of the input that are correct.

Graceful error handling requires quality error reporting as well as recovery.
Error _reporting_ means identifying errors and understanding what went wrong.
Error _recovery_ is the ability to continue parsing after an error.
Error reporting is non-trivial for PEG grammars, but error recovery is harder still.
Peg Pack aims to be as versatile as possible when it comes to error recovery, and as such implements error recovery upon a small set of primitives &mdash; much in the same way that repetition is defined in terms of choices and sequences.

## Errors

Previously, we've constructed rules that simply fail on malformed input, but it'd be nice to match strings that are "close enough" to something correct and annotate the erroneous parts.
Constructing such rules can be complicated, so we'll build up to it.
Let's begin by producing those error annotations that tell us which parts of the input are wrong.
Conceptually, error annotations are very similar to the labels that were introduced in the last chapter, and in fact you can think or errors as being a special kind of label.
One difference is that an error annotation not only wraps the rule being tagged, but also references an _expected rule_.
The expected rule of an error is generally the rule that would have matched instead had the input been correct.
By specifying expected rules, Peg Pack is able to help you craft quality error messages.

Let's say we want to create a rule that matches the string `foo`, but will also accept `bar` with a soft error.
It is unlikely you would _really_ want to create such a rule, but it's important to be able to do it nonetheless:

```javascript
const correct = () => "foo";
module.exports = g.choice(correct, g.error(correct)("bar"));
```

Here we used the `g.error(_)(_)` combinator.
The first argument list corresponds to the expected rule(s) for the error (if you specify multiple, it treats them as if they were first wrapped in a choice).
The second argument is the thing that is matched and wrapped in an error.
It is important to note that if a completely different string is parsed, such as `buzz`, then the whole rule will unconditionally fail as before.
If you run this with the interactive mode, you can see that Peg Pack does indeed produce an error annotation when matching `bar`.
You'll notice that Peg Pack also included the string `foo` in the error annotation, which was derived from the expected rule given to the `g.error(_)(_)` combinator.
When producing an error, a set of literals (strings, like `foo`) and labels will be deduced from the expected rule and exposed in the generated parser API.
You can use these expected literals and labels to conveniently format error messages.

## Strict and non-strict choice

Previously it was noted that there are two subtly different choice combinators: `g.choice(...)` and `g.strictChoice(...)`.
The difference is in handling errors.
Consider the rule `g.choice(first, second)` where both `first` and `second` match.
In the absence of soft-errors, `first` will always be chosen as the combinators result, but things become more complicated otherwise:

1. If one of `first` or `second` fails to match, the other one will become the result.
2. If both `first` and `second` are error-free, `first` will become the result.
   A parse result is error-free if it does not contain any soft-errors.
3. If exactly one of `first` or `second` is error-free, it will become the result.
4. If both `first` and `second` have errors, then the one with the greatest error-distance becomes the result.
   The error distance of a parse result is the number of consumed bytes before the start of the first soft-error.
5. If `first` and `second` both have errors and the same error-distance, `first` becomes the result.

If we generalize error-distances to include hard match failures, as well as error-free results, then the `g.choice(...)` combinator will return whichever result is greatest according to the following ordering (with preference given to the first rule in the case of a tie):

$$
\text{failed to match} < 0 < 1 < 2 < \cdots < \text{error-free}
$$

Strict choice is much simpler: `g.strictChoice(...)` returns the first successful match, whether it is error-free or not.
Formally, `g.strictChoice(first, second)` is defined to be equivalent to `g.choice(first, g.seq(g.notAhead(first), second))`.
This is also a perfectly good _implementation_; the optimizer will always lower this pattern down to an intrinsic.

## The `recover` combinator

Usually we don't just want to unconditionally produce errors though, we want to conditionally produce them only when the input is wrong.
A common pattern is matching a rule, then, if it fails, discarding input until it does match.
Suppose we want to parse a semicolon, but if there is some erroneous input before the semicolon it should be discarded with an error.
We can write this as:

```javascript
module.exports = g.recover()(";");
```

If you feed this grammar the input `foo;`, you'll see that a soft-error gets produced for each byte of input before the semicolon.

Notice the empty first argument list?
That lets us specify one or more synchronization rules.
If the `g.recover(...)(_)` combinator would discard a byte of input, it first checks that none of the synchronization rules match.
If one of them does match, a final soft-error is produced but no more input is discarded.
Essentially, synchronization rules specify points where it is safe to assume the target rule was forgotten.
A natural example of this is the end of input, which incidentally is always included as a synchronization rule.
If the end of input is reached we shouldn't (and can't) keep discarding bytes until we find our desired rule.
Another example for the above grammar would be `}`, which might denote the end of a function or block.
If the parser is looking for a semicolon and encounters a close brace, it should probably give up and assume the semicolon was forgotten.

Let's modify our grammar:

```javascript
module.exports = g.recover("}")(";");
```

Now if we try the input `foo}` we will get an error for each letter in `foo` as well as a final error that indicates the semicolon was missed.
Note that in this case the close brace is not consumed, so subsequent rules can match it.

By default, the recover combinator skips bytes at a time, but this is often not what we want.
Let's say we want to parse the keyword `null` with the rule `g.recover()("null")`.
If we apply the input `abcnull`, we probably want the whole string to be an error, rather than just the `abc`.
Furthermore, it might be useful to parse the contents of an error for syntax highlighting or diagnostic purposes.
The solution is to discard some kind of token, rather than an individual byte, from within `g.recover(...)(_)`.
We'll see how to do this in the [grammar interfaces chapter](custom-grammar-interfaces).

## The `then` combinator

It is sometimes useful to use `g.recover(...)(_)` directly, but there is often a more applicable higher-level construct.
The `g.then(...)(...)` combinator is a useful replacement for uses of `g.seq(...)` where all but the first rule are wrapped in `g.recover(...)(_)`.
This is best shown with an example:

```javascript
module.exports = g.then(foo)(bar, baz, buzz);
```

Is equivalent to:

```javascript
module.exports = g.seq(bar, g.recover(foo)(baz), g.recover(foo)(buzz));
```

## Error recovery and repetition

Many languages have constructs where some piece of syntax is repeated an unknown number of times up until a terminating symbol is reached.
For example, the statements in a function are repeated until a closing `}` is found.
The `g.until(...)(_)` and `g.untilOne(...)(_)` combinators provide error-sensitive alternatives to `g.rep(_)` and `g.repOne(_)` where such a terminating symbol can be identified.
A function body might then be written as:

```javascript
module.exports = h.then()("{", h.until("}")(statement), "}");
```

As you might expect, `g.untilOne(...)(_)` requires at least one repetition to match.
Both of these combinators also take an optional separator in the second argument list, much like `g.rep(_)` and `g.repOne(_)`.
