# Using generated parsers

:::info
You can explore the Rustdoc for the generated parsing API [here](pathname:///rustdoc/parser).

Using Peg Pack's interactive mode is good for testing but is insufficient for integrating into an actual project.
Here we'll present a full example of how you can integrate Peg Pack into a Rust project by building a primitive command line email address parser.

First, let's create a new project with `cargo`:

```
cargo new --bin peg-pack-demo
```

Brilliant.
We'll now add a grammar file to `src/grammar.js`.
Since we're just trying to get acquainted with the Peg Pack API, we'll use the following extremely reductive grammar:

```js
const user = () => g.repOne(g.noneOf("@"));
const domainName = () => g.repOne(g.noneOf("."));
const tld = () => g.choice("com", "net", "org");
const domain = () => g.seq(domainName, ".", tld);
module.exports = g.seq(user, "@", domain, g.eof);
```

You should be able to understand this grammar based on the previous chapters, but if not go back and have a look [here](./creating-a-grammar).
Note that we've included `g.eof` at the end of our top-level sequence, so any trailing whitespace, including newlines in the interactive mode, will prevent a match.

With that out of the way, make sure you've [installed peg-pack](./using-the-cli) and run the following command in the root of the project to generate the parser:

```
peg-pack src/grammar.js
```

You'll see that a `peg-pack-out` directory has been created.
This should be added to your `.gitignore` if you have one.

We can now add some boilerplate to our `src/main.rs` to read standard input into a byte slice:

```rust
use std::io::{Read, stdin};

// highlight-start
// We can use a #[path] attribute to specify where to load the module from
#[path = "../peg-pack-out/parser.rs"]
mod parser;
// highlight-end

use parser::*;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).expect("could not read input");
    let input = input.trim().as_bytes();

    println!("Received: {:?}", input);
}
```

From there we can simply use the `parse` function to parse our input:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ...

    // highlight-start
    let parse = parser::parse(input);
    println!("{:?}", parse);
    // highlight-end
}
```

Here we passed a byte slice into the `parse` function, but you can create a custom struct implementing `parser::Input` and pass a reference to that if you wish.

If you `cargo run` the project you should be able to see it printing either `Unmatched` or `Matched(Match)` depending on whether you entered a valid email address.
The `parse` function returns a `Parse` enum, so we can match on that to provide a better experience if we wish:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ...

    // highlight-start
    match parser::parse(input) {
        Parse::Matched(_) => println!("Valid email address"),
        Parse::Unmatched => println!("Invalid email address"),
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

## The visitor API

The tuple field embedded in `Parse::Matched` is a `ParseMatch`, which we can inspect to garner more information about the labels and errors in our parse.
Unfortunately, our grammar does not currently utilize errors or labels.
Let's fix that:

```js
const user = () => g.label("user", g.repOne(g.noneOf("@")));
const domainName = () =>
  g.label("domain_name", g.choice(g.repOne(g.noneOf("."))));
const tld = () => g.label("tld", g.choice("com", "net", "org"));
const domain = () => g.label("domain", g.seq(domainName, ".", tld));
module.exports = g.seq(g.recover("")(user), "@", g.recover("")(domain), g.eof);
```

Here we've labelled each major component of our email address and used `g.recover(...)(_)` to gracefully handle missing (but not malformed) users or domains.
There are better ways to handle errors, but this suffices for our example.

The visitor API lets you walk the parse tree using the [visitor design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).
Simply implement one or more of the methods in the `Visitor` trait and profit.

We can now use the visitor API to print detailed information about the parse:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ...

    // highlight-start
    struct Visitor<'a>(&'a [u8]);

    impl<'a> parser::Visitor for Visitor<'a> {
        fn enter(&mut self, info: VisitorEnterInfo) -> VisitResult {
            let start = info.position as usize;
            let end = start + info.length as usize;
            let text = String::from_utf8_lossy(&self.0[start..end]);
            println!("{:?}: {}", info.label, text);
            VisitResult::Continue
        }

        fn enter_error(&mut self, info: VisitorEnterErrorInfo) -> VisitResult {
            println!("Missing {:?}", info.expected_labels[0]);
            VisitResult::Continue
        }
    }

    match parser::parse(input) {
        Parse::Matched(result) => result.visit(&mut Visitor(input)),
        Parse::Unmatched => println!("Invalid email address"),
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

If we rerun `peg-pack src/grammar.js` and feed our application `@gmail.com` then it'll echo the following back to us:

```
Missing User
Domain: gmail.com
DomainName: gmail
Tld: com
```

## Using the cursor API

The visitor API is well and good if you need to search the parse tree in one operation, but sometimes you want to traverse the parse tree intermittently.
For such use cases, you can use the `Cursor` API.
Conceptually, a cursor is just a pointer to either a label or error produced by the parser.
The exception to this rule is the singleton cursor that points to the root of the parse tree.
Even if the parse tree is entirely enclosed in a label or error, there is still a conceptual root node wrapping it.

Anyway, here's how we could extract the domain of an email:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ...

    match parser::parse(input) {
        Parse::Matched(result) => {
            // highlight-start
            let domain = result
                .root()
                .search(|cursor| cursor.grouping() == Grouping::Label(Label::Domain))
                .next();

            if let Some(domain) = domain {
                let start = domain.position() as usize;
                let end = start + domain.length() as usize;
                let text = String::from_utf8_lossy(&input[start..end]);
                println!("Domain: {}", text)
            } else {
                println!("Domain is missing!");
            }
            // highlight-end
        }
        Parse::Unmatched => println!("Invalid email address"),
    }
}
```

Check the cursor [Rustdoc](pathname:///rustdoc/parser/struct.Cursor.html) for more information.

## Using a build script

When we want to make changes to our grammar and run the project we need to run two separate commands to generate the parser and run the program respectively.
It would be nice if we could just `cargo run` and have our parser built for us.
Thankfully, we can use [build scripts](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) to do exactly that!
Create a `build.rs` file in the root &mdash; not the `src` directory &mdash; of the project and populate it with the following snippet:

```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/grammar.js");
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=peg-pack-out");

    let status = Command::new("peg-pack")
        .arg("src/grammar.js")
        .status()
        .expect("failed to run peg-pack");

    if !status.success() {
        panic!("peg-pack exited with non-zero status");
    }
}
```

Now whenever you build your project through `cargo`, the parser will automatically be built as well.
Also, if the parser hasn't changed since the last compilation, then the build script won't be invoked.
So don't stress overly about compile times.
