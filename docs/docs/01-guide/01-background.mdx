# Background

Peg Pack is a *parser generator*. 
You feed it a [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) and the command line tool generates code to parse your language for you.
If you've ever worked with [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) or [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) you'll see that this project is in a similar vein.
Parser generators will usually take a grammar file in some (often bespoke) language and output a parser in a general purpose programming language for inclusion into a larger project.
Peg Pack grammar files are specified in plain Javascript and generate a Rust module that can be easily included from other Rust source files.

There are a variety of techniques and algorithms for implementing parsers and parser generators, with no clear best option.
Peg Pack chooses to base its parsing model on the [parsing expression grammars](https://bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf) as opposed to the bottom-up formalisms more commonly employed by parser generators.
This comes with several advantages:

* PEG grammars are unambiguous; there is at most one possible parse tree that can be generated by a PEG parser.
* Parsing expressions are intuitive; each parsing rule is conceptually just a function.
  This means a PEG grammar closely corresponds to the [recursive decent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) you would likely write by hand.
  This property also means that parsing expressions compose nicely.
* PEG parsing provides linear time complexity guarantees when combined with the [Packrat](https://bford.info/pub/lang/packrat-icfp02.pdf) algorithm.

## Use cases

Here are some of the reasons you might want to use Peg Pack over other parser generators:

* You want high quality error recovery that can be tweaked as needed.
* You want to be able to specify your grammars with the full power of Javascript rather than a constrained DSL.
* You don't want your parser generator to assume anything about your language like whitespace or character encoding.

On the other hand, you shouldn't use Peg Pack if:

* You need the stability provided by a mature, battle-tested library.
* You need very high performance parsing.
  If so, consider writing your own handcrafted parser.
* You want the simplest and tersest possible way of specifying a grammar.
* You need incremental parsing.
  This is a planned but unimplemented feature.
* You need left recursion and can't tolerate expressing left recursive constructs with right recursion.
  Once again, this is a planned but not yet implemented.
